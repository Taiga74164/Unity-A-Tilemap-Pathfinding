# Unity A* Tilemap Pathfinding
A simple implementation of A* pathfinding on a tilemap grid for 2D games. This project uses Priority Queues for efficient pathfinding.

## Features
- Fast pathfinding.
- Integration with Unity's Tilemap system.

## Usage
1. Attach the `PathfindingGrid` script to a GameObject in your scene and configure the settings.
2. Attach the `Pathfinder` script to any GameObject that requires pathfinding functionality.
3. Use the provided example in `EnemyController` or implement your own logic.
